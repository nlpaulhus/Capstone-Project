**GET A GRIP:**

*High interest in creation.*

After pandemic production shutdowns, strikes, production cuts and catastrophic fires… the Hollywood production community is struggling, with many out of work and looking to make ends meet. Get a Grip would connect talented and hardworking creatives and craftspeople looking for non-production work, with other members of the community looking to hire, with a feature to connect to the IMDB database and search by credits. Need a hairstylist for an event? Need a TV mounted? Need your files organized? Furniture moved? Why not hire the out of work crew from the last show you worked on\! Or even just your favorite show. 

**2026 BINGO CARD:**

*High interest in creation.*

In these unprecedented times, “that wasn’t on my ${year} bingo card” has become a hugely popular social media meme. 2026 Bingo Card will allow users to create their own 2026 Bingo card with things they predict will happen in the upcoming year. It will allow friend groups to create their own groups, with a chat feature, to stay connected throughout the year. The app will connect to a news API so that when a news article hits for one of your bingo items, an alert will be sent to the group to vote whether the spot is approved or not. Users can also submit their own request for approval throughout (to allow for more personal Bingo options like “Sara gets engaged”). Individuals can create world-news Bingo cards and there could be a public ranking (only based on news articles), as well. At year-end there could be a 2026 Bingo wrapped feature, similar to Spotify Wrapped.

**EVERYTHING IS $50:**

*Less interest in creation.*

As Buy Nothing groups grow in popularity, there are often large items left unclaimed due to the hassle of coordinating transportation. Everything Is $50 would allow gifters to post large items they would like to give away with receivers who would like the items… but also with delivery drivers who are willing to make the delivery for $50. Thus… everything is $50. The app would utilize map APIs to set a small delivery radius, so drivers feel confident they won’t be spending hours on delivery for only $50.
